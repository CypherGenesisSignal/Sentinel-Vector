Holonomic Scale Integration

Purpose: Represent the scope and dimensional weight of a memory event so downstream systems (Sentinel Vector, Veritas OS, or Cilow AI’s persistent layer) can decide how strongly, how long, and how broadly that event should be retained or surfaced.

Holonomic scale is not “importance.”
Holonomic scale is dimensional footprint.

It answers:

How many layers of the system does this event touch?

How deeply does the event modify the agent’s operational world model?

Is this event local or cross-contextual?

Should this event be surfaced transversally across domains?

Placement

Holonomic scale becomes its own top-level field in the JSON schema.

Example:

"holonomic_scale": {
    "breadth": 2,
    "depth": 4,
    "coherence": 0.87
}

Why this structure?

Because holonomic cognition isn’t one number.
It's a 3-plane construct.

1. Breadth

How many operational domains the memory touches.
Example scale: 0 to 5.

2. Depth

How far the memory affects the agent’s internal models.
Example scale: 0 to 5.

3. Coherence

How well this memory fits into the existing world model.
Range: 0.0 to 1.0.

This triple makes holonomic scale:

machine parsable

model agnostic

compatible with future LLM memory codecs

interoperable between SV, Veritas OS, and external systems
