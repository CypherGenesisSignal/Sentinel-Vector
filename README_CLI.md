# Sentinel Vector: Cybersecurity Battle Dome Simulator

Sentinel Vector is a cyber "battle dome" simulation CLI that lets you orchestrate Red (attack), Blue (defend), Green (recon), and Purple (report) agent actionsâ€”all from the command line. Each agent is a stub designed for safe, educational, and ethical security testing.

- **Focus:** Simulation only, for learning and demonstration.
- **All attack/detection logic is simulated and non-operational.**

### Key Features
- Modular CLI for cybersecurity battle role-play
- Red/Blue/Green/Purple agent stubs (expandable via prompts)
- Safe for classroom, lab, and open-source demonstration
- No real vulnerability or exploit logic included
