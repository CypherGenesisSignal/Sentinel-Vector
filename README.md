# Sentinel Vector

Sentinel Vector is a modular, multi-agent cybersecurity framework that uses coordinated agent teams to monitor, classify, and respond to system activity in real time. The architecture includes specialized Red, Blue, Green, and Purple agents, a central orchestrator, a persistence layer with holonomic memory processing, and tools pipelines for threat simulation and defense automation. The framework is designed for high signal clarity, clean separation of concerns, multidimensional reasoning, and future integration with Veritas OS and Cilow AI persistence systems.
