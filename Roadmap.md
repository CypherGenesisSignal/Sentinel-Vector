# 🛣️ Sentinel Vector Roadmap

**Version:** 0.1 (2025-09-01)  
**Author:** ZeroGray Ops

## 📌 Purpose

Sentinel Vector is a multi-agent security simulation framework.  
**Goal:** Orchestrate Red / Blue / Green / Purple agents to run attack, defense, recon, and coordination in one structured pipeline.

---

## 🔄 Phases

**1. Stub CLI (✅ Current)**  
- Implemented `sv_cli.py` with argparse.
- Supports role-based subcommands: `attack`, `detect`, `recon`, `report`.
- Outputs logs, stub JSON artifacts, and Markdown reports.
- Clear `# TODO` hooks for AI integration.

**2. Simulation Expansion (⏳ Next)**  
- Expand stubs into richer fake outputs using Codex or similar tooling.
- Each role simulates realistic but safe activity:
  - Red → fake SQL injection payloads.
  - Blue → detection sweeps, anomaly tagging.
  - Green → DNS/WHOIS recon stubs.
  - Purple → consolidate into structured report.

**3. Pipeline Wiring**  
- Replace stub calls with existing Sentinel Vector modules:
  - `modules/recon/`
  - `modules/analyze/`
  - `modules/report/`
- Connect CLI to `pipeline/etl.py`, `ioc_normalize.py`, `render_md.py`, etc.
- Artifacts flow into `cases/` with hash manifests and audit logs.

**4. AI Agent Integration**  
- Plug AI models into role hooks:
  - Red Agents: simulate attack vectors + payload generation.
  - Blue Agents: parse logs, flag anomalies, suggest defenses.
  - Green Agents: run OSINT sweeps, normalize IOCs.
  - Purple Agent: orchestrator; consolidate findings, generate reports.

**5. Production Hardening**  
- Add profiles for lab, default, and hardened deployments.
- Ensure encrypted vault storage for evidence.
- Expand reporting into executive + technical templates.
- Add CI/CD tests (`tests/unit`, `tests/integration`).

---

## 📂 Milestone Outputs

- **Cases:** Structured per-date folders, with artifacts + notes.
- **Reports:** Markdown + PDF bundles.
- **Audit:** JSON logs with timestamps + SHA256 manifest.

## 🚀 Vision

Sentinel Vector evolves from a CLI stub into a multi-agent simulation lab, powered by AI and structured pipelines.  
**Final goal:** Provide companies and teams with safe, repeatable red/blue/purple exercises to test defenses and strengthen detection.
